# BeatSaber

This is a project I took on when I hit a snag while mapping Mind Brand for Beat Saber.
After the first notable update to the game, my game would freeze for just a moment
when starting a song. Unfortunately for me, that moment was the exact moment Mind Brand's
first notes were supposed to be hit. So, I had to move ALL the notes backwards by a certain
amount of time. The current editor didn't have that capability, so I made my own little
project which you see here.

It moves notes, obstacles, and lighting events.
